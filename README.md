Ancient Rim is a mod series that expands the cultural and technoligial timeline beyond the vanilla neolithic, industrial and spacer stages.
The Mediterran Factions mod populates RimWorld with factions that use the gear addet by Ancient Rim - Mediterran Edition/ SPQRim.

Details:

Rome and Sparta that have neutral or slightly negative relation to the player
Hellada which is rather friendly
Macedonia which is hostile and won't pursue for peace in its imperial interest
